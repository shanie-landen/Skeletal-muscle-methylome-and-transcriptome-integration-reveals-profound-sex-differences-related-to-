# Sex-specific-skeletal-muscle-DNA-methylation

#in this code:
#1. preprocessing of DNA methylation illumina epic array to be used in the meta analysis (METAL software)
#2. code to analyze DNA methylation data for sex differences. Identifications of differentially methylated positions, regions, and genes. Differential methylation is overlapped with GTEx and FUSION differentially expressed genes. Genomic locations of differential methylation are explored. Gene set enrichment analysis is performed.
